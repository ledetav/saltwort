# TASKS
## Task 1

> Four sets are fed to the input of the program, which are converted according to the following formula: **(A&B)||(U\C)**.

**Requirements:**
- The composition of each set is entered by the keyboard user;
- The set is entered into the line separated by a space, then converted into a set of integers;
- The input to the set is completed when the user press Enter;
- The set can consist only of integers, otherwise an error message is displayed and the user is prompted to enter another data set;
- At the end, the program outputs the answer in the form of a transformed set. 

## Task 2

> How many integers are there between 0 and 999 containing exactly **one** digit 7?

## Task 3

> How many numbers in the range from 0 to 999,999 do **not contain** two adjacent identical digits?

## Task 4

> How many integers from 1 to 100 are **not divisible** by two, three, or five?

## Task 5

> Generate all possible k-combinations of n elements.

**Input data format:**
- Two numbers k and n separated by a space. The condition is guaranteed to be fulfilled for them: **0≤k≤n**.

**Output data format:**
- The required number of rows, each of which contains k numbers from the range from 0 to n-1 inclusive, separated by a space.

**Sample Input 1:**
```2 3```

**Sample Output 1:**
```
0 1
0 2
1 2
```

**Sample Input 2:**
```1 1```

**Sample Output 2:**
```0```

## Task 6
> How many six-digit numbers are there whose sum of digits does not exceed 47?

## Task 7
> How many binary (i.e. consisting of digits 0 and 1) strings of length n containing k units in which no two units stand side by side?
- Solve the task in the general case, and as an answer enter the number of such strings for **n = 42** and **k = 7**.

## Task 8
> How many numbers less than a million can be written using the digits 8 and/or 9?

## Task 9

> How many six-digit numbers are there, all digits of which have the same parity? For example, in the number 222222, all digits are even.

## Task 10

> Generate all possible k-permutations of n-elements without repetitions.

**Format input data:**
Two numbers n and k separated by a space. The condition is guaranteed to be fulfilled for them: **0 < k ≤ n**.

**Output data format:**
The required number of lexicographically ordered strings, each of which contains k numbers from **0 to n-1**, separated by a space.

**Sample Input:**
```
4 2
```

**Sample Output:**
```
0 1
0 2
0 3
1 0
1 2
1 3
2 0
2 1
2 3
3 0
3 1
3 2
```

## Task 11

> From a group consisting of 7 men and 4 women, it is necessary to choose 6 people so that there are at least 2 women among them. How many ways can this be done?
