# TASKS
## Task 1

> Four sets are fed to the input of the program, which are converted according to the following formula: **(A&B)||(U\C)**.

**Requirements:**
- The composition of each set is entered by the keyboard user;
- The set is entered into the line separated by a space, then converted into a set of integers;
- The input to the set is completed when the user press Enter;
- The set can consist only of integers, otherwise an error message is displayed and the user is prompted to enter another data set;
- At the end, the program outputs the answer in the form of a transformed set. 

## Task 2

> How many integers are there between 0 and 999 containing exactly **one** digit 7?

## Task 3

> How many numbers in the range from 0 to 999,999 do **not contain** two adjacent identical digits?

## Task 4

> How many integers from 1 to 100 are **not divisible** by two, three, or five?

## Task 5

> It is required to generate all possible k-combinations of n elements.

**Input data format:**
- Two numbers k and n separated by a space. The condition is guaranteed to be fulfilled for them: **0≤k≤n**.

**Output data format:**
- The required number of rows, each of which contains k numbers from the range from 0 to n-1 inclusive, separated by a space.

**Sample Input 1:**
```2 3```

**Sample Output 1:**
```
0 1
0 2
1 2
```

**Sample Input 2:**
```1 1```

**Sample Output 2:**
```0```

## Task 6
> How many six-digit numbers are there whose sum of digits does not exceed 47?
